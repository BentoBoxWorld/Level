# Number of concurrent island calculations
# If your CPU can handle it, you can run parallel island calcs if there are more than one in the queue

# Island level calculation timeout in minutes.
# If an island takes longer that this time to calculate, then the calculation will abort.
# Generally, calculation should only take a few seconds, so if this ever triggers then something is not right.

# Zero island levels on new island or island reset
# If true, Level will calculate the starter island's level and remove it from any future level calculations.
# If this is false, the player's starter island blocks will count towards their level.
# This will reduce CPU if false.

# 
# Calculate island level on login
# This silently calculates the player's island level when they login
# This applies to all islands the player has on the server, e.g., BSkyBlock, AcidIsland

# 
# Include nether island in level calculations.
# Warning: Enabling this mid-game will give players with an island a jump in
# island level. New islands will be correctly zeroed.

# Include end island in level calculations.
# Warning: Enabling this mid-game will give players with an island a jump in

# Include chest contents in level calculations.
# Will count blocks in chests or containers.

# Underwater block multiplier
# If blocks are below sea-level, they can have a higher value. e.g. 2x
# Promotes under-water development if there is a sea. Value can be fractional.

# 
# Island level calculation formula
# blocks - the sum total of all block values, less any death penalty
# level_cost - in a linear equation, the value of one level
# This formula can include +,=,*,/,sqrt,^,sin,cos,tan,log (natural log). Result will always be rounded to a long integer
# for example, an alternative non-linear option could be: 3 * sqrt(blocks / level_cost)

# Cooldown between level requests in seconds

# 
# Death penalty
# How many block values a player will lose per death.
# Default value of 100 means that for every death, the player will lose 1 level (if levelcost is 100)
# Set to zero to not use this feature
deathpenalty: 100
# Sum team deaths - if true, all the teams deaths are summed
# If false, only the leader's deaths counts
# For other death related settings, see the GameModeAddon's config.yml settings.

# Shorthand island level
# Shows large level values rounded down, e.g., 10,345 -> 10k
