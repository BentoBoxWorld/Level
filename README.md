## 🔍 What is Level?

**Level** is the ultimate competition booster for your BentoBox server! Designed for game modes like **BSkyBlock**, **AcidIsland**, and more, this powerful add-on turns your island into a battleground of **block-by-block domination**.

Every block you place counts toward your **island level**—and every block you lose could cost you your spot in the rankings. Whether you're aiming for the top ten or just flexing your creative builds, **Level** adds stakes, strategy, and excitement to your sky-high journey.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to level up? Here's how to launch **Level** on your server:

1. Drop the **Level** add-on `.jar` into your BentoBox `addons` folder.
2. Restart your server and let the magic happen.
3. A new `Level` data folder and `config.yml` will be created.
4. Open `config.yml` and customize block values, settings, and behavior to suit your game mode.
5. Restart your server again to apply changes.

Now you’re all set—go build something worth leveling for! 🏗️

## 🔄 Upgrading

When updating, always read the **release notes**!  
Some updates might require a fresh `config.yml`, so make backups and review changes carefully.

---

## 🛡️ Permissions

**Level** integrates directly with your permissions plugin, giving players the tools to compete while letting admins keep control.

Default permissions for **BSkyBlock**, **AcidIsland**, and **CaveBlock**:

```
permissions:    
  bskyblock.intopten:             # Show up in top 10
    default: true
  bskyblock.island.level:         # Use /is level
    default: true
  bskyblock.island.top:           # Use /is top
    default: true
  bskyblock.island.value:         # Use /is value
    default: true
  bskyblock.admin.level:          # Admin access to /is level
    default: true
  bskyblock.admin.topten:         # Admin access to /is topten
    default: true
```

⚠️ Players need `intopten` to appear in the leaderboard!

## ⚙️ Configuration: Make It Yours

The `config.yml` file gives you total control over how leveling works. Here's a breakdown of what you can tweak:

### 🎮 Game Mode Hook
Tell Level which BentoBox game modes it should connect to.

### ⚙️ General Settings
- **Underwater Block Multiplier** – Give bonus points for blocks below sea level.
- **Level Cost** – Set how many points are needed to gain 1 island level.
- **Level Wait** – Add a cooldown between level scans.
- **Death Penalty** – Punish deaths with level loss.
- **Sum Team Deaths** – Choose whether to track team deaths or just the leader's.
- **Reset on Island Reset / Team Join** – Wipe the death count when teams change or islands are reset.

### 📐 Level Calculation Formula

The `level-calc` setting in `config.yml` controls how island levels are computed. It supports the following variables:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `blocks` | The total block value points for the island, minus any death penalty |
| `level_cost` | The value of one island level (see `levelcost` setting) |
| `island_members` | The number of members currently on the island team |

The formula can use `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, and `log` (natural log). The result is rounded to the nearest whole number.

**Default formula:** `blocks / level_cost`

**Handicap (fairness) example:** To divide the island level equally per member so solo islands remain competitive with larger teams, use:

```yaml
level-calc: "blocks / level_cost / island_members"
```

With this formula and the default `level_cost` of `100`, a block worth 100 points would contribute the following to the **island level**:
- **0.25 levels** per block on an island with 4 members (100 / 100 / 4 = 0.25)
- **0.33 levels** per block on an island with 3 members (100 / 100 / 3 ≈ 0.33)
- **1 level** per block on a solo island (100 / 100 / 1 = 1)

This makes competition fairer between solo players and large teams.

### 🚫 Block Limits
Cap the number of specific blocks that count toward level (e.g., only 200 DIAMOND_BLOCKs count).

Format:
```
DIAMOND_BLOCK: 200
```

### 💎 Block Values
Assign point values to blocks to reward rare or hard-to-get materials.

Format:
```
STONE: 1
DIAMOND_BLOCK: 100
```

Blocks not listed are worth **0**. `AIR` is always ignored.

### 🌍 World-Specific Values
Customize block values for individual worlds or game modes.

Example:
```yaml
worlds:
  AcidIsland_world:
    SAND: 0
    SANDSTONE: 0
    ICE: 0
```

In this setup, **AcidIsland** disables points for sand-based blocks while using default values for everything else.
